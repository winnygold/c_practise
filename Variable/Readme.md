## Variable : 

To understand Variable for scratch we have to understand memory. 

#### Memory: 

The terms bit , byte and word can be used to describe the units of computer
memory.The smallest unit of memory is called bit. You can't store much in 1 bit
, it can be either 1 or 0 . More like a yes or no . 

Since each bit can be 0 or 1 , there are 256 by combining 8 bit as 1 Byte. Numbers can be easily represented as Binary.

Storing float value is different from storing integer. For example : 7.00 is a
float where the storage will be done in sign fraction and exponent which is + ,
0.7 , 1.
