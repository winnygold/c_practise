## Data Types : 

constant : these are type of data where the data is preset before the program is
used and the value of the data is unchanged throught the life of the program.

Variable : These are types of data where their value can be changed on the fly
when the program is being executed. 

Data type has to be announced for the compiler to understand what kind of data
type it is . 

```
int     signed      _Bool
long    void        _Complex
short               _Imaginary
unsigned
char
float      
double
```
C offers more than int , but you may wonder why its that a case. Its because of
the ranges of values available. int is a signed integer which means its positive
negative or Zero.
